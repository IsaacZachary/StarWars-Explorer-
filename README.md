 StarWars Explorer is a Shiny app that allows users to visualize data from the Star Wars universe. With three inputs and two outputs, users can select a character, movie, and variable to display in a summary table and scatterplot. The app uses the Tidy Tuesday Star Wars dataset and is an interactive way to explore the data.
